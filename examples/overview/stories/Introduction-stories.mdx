# Welcome to @storybook/builder-vite examples

This "Overview" example composes together the various framework examples in the [@storybook/builder-vite monorepo](https://github.com/storybookjs/builder-vite/tree/main/examples). It builds them into a single deployable bundle using [bookcase-builder](https://github.com/dohooo/bookcase-builder) and publishes them to GitHub pages at https://storybookjs.github.io/builder-vite/overview.
